# news_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Upon launching the app, the user is presented with two screens:
1. Where they see current news.
2. Where they can select based on their search keywords, preferred country and topic of interest. 

The app then fetches the latest news articles based on the user's selection and displays them in a scrollable list.

Each news article is displayed with its headline, a short summary, and an image if available. Tapping on a news article takes the user to a detailed view of the article where they can read the full article.

The app also includes a search feature that allows users to search for news articles based on keywords. Users can save articles to read later or share them with their friends and family.

The app is designed with a user-friendly interface that allows for easy navigation and customization. Users can personalize their news feed by selecting the countries and topics that interest them the most.

Overall, this Flutter app is a convenient way for users to stay up-to-date with the latest news from around the world.
